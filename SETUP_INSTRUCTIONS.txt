HOW TO CREATE THE GITHUB REPO AND PUBLISH WKLink
=================================================

1. CREATE THE REPO ON GITHUB
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: WKLink
   - Description: WinKeyer USB to VBand bridge for CW practice
   - Set to Public
   - Do NOT initialize with README (you already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. INITIALIZE AND PUSH FROM YOUR LOCAL FOLDER
   Open a terminal in C:\Users\email\source\repos\catriname\WKLink and run:

   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial release"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/catriname/WKLink.git
   git push -u origin main

3. CREATE YOUR FIRST RELEASE (triggers the EXE build)
   Run these commands to tag version 1.0.0:

   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0

   GitHub Actions will then:
   - Spin up a Windows VM
   - Install Python + dependencies
   - Build WKLink.exe with PyInstaller
   - Create a Release at github.com/catriname/WKLink/releases
   - Attach WKLink.exe as a downloadable asset

4. SHARE THE DOWNLOAD LINK
   After the build completes (~3-4 minutes), the link will be:
   https://github.com/catriname/WKLink/releases/latest

   You can also link directly to the latest EXE:
   https://github.com/catriname/WKLink/releases/latest/download/WKLink.exe

5. FUTURE RELEASES
   Every time you want to publish a new version:

   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe what changed"
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push && git push origin v1.0.1

   GitHub Actions rebuilds and publishes automatically.

FOLDER STRUCTURE CHECK
Make sure your folder looks like this before pushing:

WKLink/
  wklink.py
  requirements.txt
  README.md
  build.bat
  .gitignore
  .github/
    workflows/
      build.yml
